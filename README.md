# Imbalanced-Dataset-Case-Study

**Business Problem** - Task is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a diabetes dataset and build a predictive model to determine whether a person is diabetic or not.

**Objective**: The objective is to design and implement a predictive model that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze relevant data and predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. By leveraging historical medical records, demographic information, and other pertinent variables, the model will provide a binary classification output, indicating whether a person is diabetic or not.

## Methodology:

1. **Data Collection**: Provided (dataset_diabetes) is originally from National Inst of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. All the patients are females, 21 years or older of Pima Indian Heritage.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the original data, handle missing values, perform feature engineering and split the dataset into training, and testing subsets.

3. **Feature Selection**: Utilized feature selection methods such as correlation analysis and feature importance graph to identify the most informative and relevant features for the predictive model.

4. **Model Selection**: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and applied multiple sampling techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE-Tomek and SMOTEENN to handle imbalanced data.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trained all 3 models on the training dataset and optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation and randomized search. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset using F1-Score and AUC-ROC which are robust metrics for evaluating imbalanced data.
